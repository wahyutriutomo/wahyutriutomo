## About Me

I help businesses optimize their operations through ERP implementation and enterprise system integration.

With 9+ years in technology and 3.5+ years specializing in ERP consulting (approaching 4 years), my career has been a journey of continuous evolution, from software engineer, to technical lead, to system analyst and ERP consulting. This progression, spanning nearly a decade, gives me something unique: I understand both the technical implementation and the business value.
