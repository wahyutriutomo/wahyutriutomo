## About Me

With 8 years of hands-on experience in software development, I started my journey with PHP and mobile apps, grew into .NET and Node.js development, and in the last few years found a strong interest in ERP and SaaS systems.

I enjoy architecting backend solutions, simplifying complex business workflows, and building systems that scale. Now, Iâ€™m preparing to take my next step: specializing in AI to unlock even more intelligent and adaptive software.
